# Patterner Plugin for Figma

## Description

This plugin allows you to create square and circular patterns in Figma.

## Installation

For now the only way to install this plugin is to clone this repository and run `yarn build` in the root directory. Then you can open Figma and go to `Plugins > Development > New Plugin...` and choose the `manifest.json` file in the `build` directory.

I'm working on getting this plugin into the Figma Community so it can be installed directly from Figma.
